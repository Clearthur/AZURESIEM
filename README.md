<h1>Creating SIEM in AZURE</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edycb0rOAKQ)

<h2>Description</h2>
Using Microsoft Azure, I created a network of virtual machines to represent an organization. I then secured two of the machines and exposed the third machine to raw internet. The purpose of this project is to show the importance of maintaining endpoint security on all devices because malicious attackers are always trying to attack vulnerable systems. The success of the exercise shows that with proper security protocols in place the threat vector from failed attempted logins can be greatly reduced to near 0.
